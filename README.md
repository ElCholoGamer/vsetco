An advertisements app for a school project.

<small>this is taking longer than expected</small>

## Todo:

- [x] Homepage posts (Kinda done)
- [x] Custom login redirect with query params
- [x] `/account` path that shows user info
- [x] Account bio/description
- [x] Posts search ~~bar~~ page
- [ ] Individual post page (Kinda done)
- [x] Post edit route and page
- [x] (Maybe) Route to check if a user has upvoted/downvoted
- [ ] Put actual effort into the CSS (damn this is getting closer)
